	\noindent{\bf Hinton} is a pioneer in artificial intelligence and deep learning, known as the "Father of Deep Learning." He promoted the backpropagation algorithm and proposed the Deep Belief Network (DBN) in 2006, leading to the resurgence of deep learning. His team developed the famous AlexNet, which marked the widespread application of deep learning in computer vision. As a professor at the University of Toronto and a researcher at Google Brain, Hinton has had a profound impact on deep learning optimization and model development. Together with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio, he is known as one of the "Three Giants of Deep Learning" and received the Turing Award in 2018.
